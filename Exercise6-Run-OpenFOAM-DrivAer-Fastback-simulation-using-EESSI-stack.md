## Exercise 6: Run OpenFOAM DrivAer-Fastback simulation using EESSI stack

The Az-HOP deployment in this tutorial comes with the [EESSI software stack](https://eessi.github.io/docs) pre-configured on all compute nodes.
In this exercise you will run and analyze the DrivAer-Fastback CFD simulation with 3 million cells without having to build OpenFOAM by using `OpenFOAM/9-foss-2021a` available in EESSI.

### Task 1: Prepare the DrivAer-Fastback example

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window displaying the Code Server, in the **Terminal** pane, at the **[clusteradmin@hb120v2-1 clusteradmin]$**  prompt, run the following command to Clone the OpenFOAM-9 repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   cd /anfhome/clusteradmin
   git clone https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-9.git
   ```

2. Copy the DrivAer-Fastback tutorial to your home directory:

   ```bash
   cp -r OpenFOAM-9/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/drivaerFastback .
   ```

3. Apply the following changes to the default tutorial:

    - Add `FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS` to the `mpirun` command when using `runParallel` (needed for all version of OpenFOAM)
    - Decompress the geometry
    - Rename `constant/geometry` to 'constant/triSurface`
    - Reconstruct the single partition after the solve

      Here are the commands:

      ```bash
      cd drivaerFastback
      sed -i '/RunFunctions/a source <(declare -f runParallel | sed "s/mpirun/mpirun \\\$FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS/g")' Allrun
      sed -i 's#/bin/sh#/bin/bash#g' Allrun
      gunzip constant/geometry/*
      mv constant/geometry constant/triSurface
      sed -i 's/# runApplication reconstructPar/runApplication reconstructPar/g' Allrun
      ```

### Task 2: Submit PBS job

1. Create a PBS submit script as `~/drivaerFastback/submit.sh`. When running on multiple nodes it is necessary to export all the OpenFOAM environment variables (unless you add loading the modules in `.bashrc`). This is done with the `FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS` that we added to the `runParallel` in the previous step. The script will run for the number of cores specified to PBS (`select` x `mpiprocs`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   source /cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/versions/2021.12/init/bash
   ml OpenFOAM/9-foss-2021a
   source $FOAM_BASH
   $PBS_O_WORKDIR/Allclean

   ranks_per_numa=30
   export FOAM_MPIRUN_FLAGS="-mca pml ucx -hostfile $PBS_NODEFILE $(env |grep 'WM_\|FOAM_' | cut -d'=' -f1 | sed 's/^/-x /g' | tr '\n' ' ') -x MPI_BUFFER_SIZE -x UCX_POSIX_USE_PROC_LINK=n -x PATH --map-by ppr:${ranks_per_numa}:numa"
   $PBS_O_WORKDIR/Allrun -m M -cores $(wc -l <$PBS_NODEFILE)
   ```

2. Submit the OpenFOAM batch job, requesting our job to be exclusively allocated to two HB120rs_v2 nodes from the node array `hb120v2`:

   ```bash
   cd drivaerFastback
   qsub -l select=2:slot_type=hb120v2:ncpus=120:mpiprocs=120,place=scatter:excl submit.sh
   ```

3. Monitor the node allocation in CycleCloud and the job until its completion by using the `qstat` command. Log files will be generated in the `~/drivaerFastback` with the pattern `log.*`. Expect the job to run for about 12 minutes.

### Task 3: Create Linux Desktop session for visualization

1. On the lab computer, in the browser window, switch back to the **Azure HPC On-Demand Platform** portal, and then in the **Interactive Apps** section, select **Linux Desktop**.

2. On the **Linux Desktop** launching page, from the **Session target** drop-down list, ensure that **With GPU - Small GPU node for single session** entry is selected. In the **Maximum duration of your remote session** field, enter **1**,  and then select **Launch**.

   > Note: This will begin compute node provisioning of the type you specified. This also creates a new job with its **Queued** status displaying on the same page.

3. Switch back to the **Linux Desktop** launching page, and then verify that the corresponding job's status has changed to **Running**.

4. Adjust **Compression** and **Image quality** according to your preferences, and then select **Launch Linux Desktop**.

   > Note: This will open another browser tab displaying the Linux Desktop session.

5. Within the Linux Desktop session, start **Terminal Emulator**.

6. Install the **ParaView** viewer:

   ```bash
   cd /anfhome/clusteradmin
   wget "https://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.10&type=binary&os=Linux&downloadFile=ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64.tar.gz" -O ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64.tar.gz
   tar xvf ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

### Task 4: Visualize the DrivAer-Fastback simulation results

1. Create a case file and launch ParaView:

   ```bash
   touch  drivaerFastback/case.foam
   vglrun ./ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64/bin/paraview
   ```

2. Within **ParaView** open the case `~/drivaerFastback/case.foam`

3. When the model is loaded, you can load the car geometry as follows:
   - In the bottom left pane, in the "Mesh Regions" list, unselect "internalMesh" and select the    following fields:
      - `patch/body`
      - `patch/frontWheels`
      - `patch/ground`
      - `patch/inlet`
      - `patch/rearWheels`
   - Click "Apply" above the list
   - You should now see the model geometry, and you can move/rotate/zoom using the mouse

4. To visualize the simulation results, click the "Play" button on the toolbar at the top of the window to advance to the end of the simulation.

5. On the Active Variables Control toolbar you will find a drop down box where you can select variables. For example, select "p" for pressure.
